<p>Owl Evalution
Owls are amazing birds and research show them to be highly adaptable to
different environment and changes.As a result of this there is no doubt
that they have been here for millon years.

Owl Feeding
The owl is very fierce and powerful hunter so most of the time they catch
the prey.They will only consume live animals so if they come across remains
that someone else has killed they will leave it alone.
