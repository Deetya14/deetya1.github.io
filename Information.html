different environment and changes.As a result of this there is no doubt
that they have been here for millon years.

The owl is very fierce and powerful hunter so most of the time they catch
the prey.They will only consume live animals so if they come across remains
that someone else has killed they will leave it alone.

habitat.They are able to live in variety of locations and some of those may 
surprise you.

Owl Predators
Owls definitely are very independent birds in the wild,but they do have predators
to worry about.They are considered to be top food chain element though so they don't
have too many problems.

For the most part owls are very isolated creatures.That all changes as spring approaches
though because that is when mating can occur.
